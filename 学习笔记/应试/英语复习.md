## The major characteristics of a good presentation

An academic presentation is a prepared and formal talk given by a speaker in public. It is a powerful way to transmit your message to an audience in a clear and structured way within a time limit. Do you know any of the characteristics of a good presentation?

Actually, a good presentation has many characteristics. The major characteristics are listed below.

A good presentation is accurate. As we know, one of the purposes of making presentations is to convey accurate and concise information about academic studies. To keep the presentation accurate, the presenters may apply some techniques such as using terminology, explaining obscure terms clearly and reducing vague expressions. If possible, the presenters may use diagrams in the presentation to illustrate their points. And flow charts can also be used in the presentation to describe complex process. The data reported in the presentation should be concrete, too.

Brevity is the soul of wit. A good presentation is also featured with brevity. A simple and brief presentation can help the audience get the most important points. The presenters can use basic words for profound meanings and lessen slides’ contents and make more oral explanations.

Another characteristic of a good presentation lies in clarity. To a presenter, it means a big failure if the audience cannot remember any of the points presented in the speech. That’s why the presenters try to think of ways to make the contents of the presentation clearly presented. For example, in the presentation, the presenters prefer to choose simpler words and sentences, helping the audience understand the meaning of the presentation as quickly as possible. They also make efforts to reinforce the slide’s attraction, such as making slides easier to follow and just containing the necessary information in the slides. 

**Accuracy**, **brevity** and **clarity** are the major characteristics of a good presentation introduced in this text. Do you know any other characteristics of a good presentation? Share with your peers about these characteristics and then discuss the tips for making the presentation so effective.

# Keynote speech writing

A keynote speech is an address designed to present the issues of primary interest to an assembly (such as a political convention) and often to arouse unity and enthusiasm. A good keynote speech is inspirational and unifying for its audience.

Before you start writing a keynote speech, you need to know:
* **WHY** you are giving a keynote speech (the purpose)
* **WHO** you are writing your speech for (the audience)
* **WHAT** your speech is going to be about (its topic, main points)
* **HOW** long your speech is going to be (its length)

The first step in developing a strong sense of speech organization is to gain command of the three basic parts of a speech—introduction, body, and conclusion—and the strategic role of each.

Your first job in the introduction is to get the attention and interest of the audience. You can do this by posing a question, telling a story, making a startling statement, or opening with a quotation. The purpose of all these methods is to create a dramatic, colorful opening that will make your audience want to hear more. In addition to gaining attention and interest, the introduction should orient your listeners toward the subject matter of your speech.

After getting the audience’s attention and revealing your topic, you are ready to move into the body of your speech. There are many ways to organize the points in a speech. The following strategic orders are commonly used to organize the speech.
1. **Chronological Order**: Speeches arranged chronologically follow a time pattern. They may narrate a series of events, explain a process or demonstrate how to do something.
2. **Spatial Order**: Speeches arranged in spatial order follow a directional pattern, i.e. the main points proceed from top to bottom, left to right, east to west, or some other route.
3. **Causal Order**: You can deal first with the effects and then with the causes.
4. **Problem-Solution Order**: Speeches arranged in problem-solution order are divided into two main parts—the existence and seriousness of a problem and a workable solution to the problem.
5. **Topical Order**: The speech topic is divided into subtopics, each of which becomes a main point in the speech.

When you finish discussing your final point, you will be ready to move onto your conclusion. You need to accomplish two tasks in this part of the speech: let the audience know you are about to finish and reinforce your major theme. You may end your speech with a direct wind-up, a brief summary or solicitation of comments.

# Closing Speech Writing

## Definition

A closing speech is a formal talk given by a distinguished guest at the closing ceremony of a conference. Generally speaking, it consists of the basic elements, such as appreciation, summary, evaluation, expectation, invitation and declaration.

## Things to Be Done

In a good closing speech, we should at least do the following things:
* thanking all the related persons and organizations
* commenting on the contributions of the conference
* noticing the arrangement for the next conference
* declaring the conference closed

Typically, the function of closing speeches is to summarize the conference and to motivate participants to take action.

## Structure

Based on the function mentioned above, we can divide the closing speech into the 5 sections:

1. Gratitude Expression: we may express thanks to keynote speakers, participants, moderator(s), organizer(s), and sponsor(s).
2. Review or Summary: we may review or summarize briefly what has been done at the conference.
3. Evaluation: we may evaluate the conference properly on the achievements, significance or influences.
4. Invitation: we may extend an invitation to the next conference.
5. Declaration: we will declare the closing of the conference.

The closing speech is the last thing that the participants will hear at the conference. Let’s make it impressive and well-organized.

# Writing instructions and user manuals

In this section, we first introduce **technical communication** and how it differs from general communication.

**Technical communication**: the process of finding and using information and sharing meaning. It includes the process of making and sharing information in the workplace, and a set of applications -- the documents you write.

**General communication** vs. **Technical communication**

General communication|Technical communication
-|-
Contains a   general message|Contains a technical message
Informal in   style and approach.|Mostly formal
No set pattern of   communication.|Follows a set pattern
Mostly oral.|Both oral and written
Not always for a specific audience|Always for a specific audience
Does not involve   the use of technical vocabulary or graphics, etc.|Frequently involves jargon, graphics, etc.

Next, we elaborate on the writing of instructions.

We start with the definition of instructions.

**Instruction**: process descriptions written to help users perform a specific task.

Then, we explain the 4-stage writing process

**planning---drafting--revising--editing**

In the *planning stage*, we analyze our target readers, the language(s) they use, the situation they read the instructions, the form of the instruction etc.

When two or more languages are used, we should consider whether to follow the *Simultaneous design* or *Sequential design*.

In the *planning stage*, we also have **safety design**. We use signal words to indicate the seriousness of the advice and put them in very prominent places. A reasonable amount of repetition may also be necessary.

In the *planning stage*, we  need to consider how to best present the instruction to make it more attractive. Use of graphics and airy design will help.

Now we come to the *drafting stage*. We can divide the instruction into four parts: title, introduction, body and conclusion.

**Title**

We have two ways to write titles, how to... or gerund. E.g. How to install a water heater or installing a water heater.

**Introduction**

We provide preliminary information in order to ensure safe and successful installing. Information of the targeted readers, purposes of this instruction, safety measures and tools to be used, duration of the task may be introduced.

**Body**

In the body part, we present step-by-step instructions on how to perform the task.

Here, we should follow the guidelines.

1. Present the right amount of information.
2. Use the imperative mood.
3. State the action first, then follow it feedback such as reasons or conditions.
4. Number the steps.
5. Don’t omit articles to save space.

**Conclusion**: in this part, we can tell our readers that they have successfully completed the task, then follow it by what to do next, or some maintenance tips or trouble-shooting guide.

**In the revising and editing steps**, we work to improve the design and the readability of the document we write. Inviting some people who are at the same understanding level of our target readers may help. Make sure that the instructions are honest, clear, accurate, comprehensive, accessible, concise, professional in appearance and correct. The ultimate goal is to ensure successful and safe installing.

User manuals are similar to instructions in many ways. They contain much of the same sort of information found in a set of instructions. The main difference between the two is that a manual has more elaborate front matter and back matter.

**Front matter and back matter** are used to describe the first and last pages of a user manual. Front matter includes table of contents, title page, conventions section, trademarks etc. Back matter refers to specifications of the device or system, safety regulations, industry code, copyright pages etc.

# Memo writing

## General introduction to memo

abbrev.: memo; from Latin *memorandum* est, "It must be remembered"

a written message that may be used in the workplace

In business:
A memo is typically used by firms or institution for **short internal communication**.

-|-
Audience|Internal
Purpose|to inform, to request information, to  persuade, to deliver bad new, or to confirm, etc.

## Samples

![memo 1](i/memo1.png)

![memo 2](i/memo2.png)

**Introduction**: the introduction should help readers get oriented to each document’s purpose and scope. Remember to establish the rhetorical context early in the introduction so that recipients understand why they’re receiving the memo and why they should continue reading.

**Body**: The body is, of course, where the bulk of your important information goes. To support readers in effectively reading your memos, you should utilize effective organizational strategies to guide readers efficiently through the memo: descriptive subheadings, bulleted lists, topic sentences and transitional sentences, and visuals to complement written text, especially complex information. 

**Conclusion**:  a. summarizes the basic message of the document, and calls readers to any necessary action that should be taken as a result.  b. Additionally, because a memo is a correspondence that seeks to maintain a positive workplace environment, it may also include a courteous closing that leaves readers with a very clear understanding of what they need to do with the information provided, e.g “Please let me know by Wednesday if you have any questions about this new policy.”

## Format

The format of a memo follows the general guidelines of technical and professional writing----block format.

1. single spaced
2. left justified (flush left)
3. Skip a line between sentences  to show new paragraphs (instead of using indentations)
4. No indents for paragraph.

Usually a page or two long.

Technical and professional materials should be concise and easy to read. Therefore, it is beneficial to use headings and lists to help the readers pinpoint certain information.
